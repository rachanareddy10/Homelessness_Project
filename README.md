# Factors Influencing Homelessness

This project investigates the key factors influencing homelessness in the United States from 2010 to 2024. Using data from public sources, it applies statistical and machine learning models to identify which socioeconomic, housing, and health-related variables contribute most to homelessness rates.

## Objective
To analyze patterns in homelessness across U.S. states and determine the most influential factors using data-driven methods.

## Project Highlights
- Collected and merged multi-year datasets from HUD, U.S. Census, and more
- Cleaned and standardized socioeconomic and housing indicators
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Built and evaluated predictive models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge & Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Analyzed feature importance to extract policy-relevant insights

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
